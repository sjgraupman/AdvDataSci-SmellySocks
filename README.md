## Website

https://sjgraupman.github.io/AdvDataSci-SmellySocks/Website/

This is the current working website of the smelly socks project run on  [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). 

The initial development of this website was done by Colin Quinn and then adapated to fit the needs of Marquette's advance data science course. Improvements to the website we made by adding interactive visualization and simulations of the data using the d3 library
